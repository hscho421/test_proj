    <p>I am a Computer Engineering student at UIUC with experience in software engineering, AI automation, and full stack development. I have interned at Samsung SDS, where I built an AI powered GUI automation agent using large language models on NVIDIA H100 GPUs, and at a Seoul based company where I developed a full stack web application and automated workflows with Google Cloud. I also enjoy building personal projects like CoursePlanner, a web app that helps students plan semesters and visualize GPA trends.</p>
